# 3D Bin Packing Problem with Metaheuristics

## **Project Overview**

This project addresses the **3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP)**, a classical NP-hard optimization problem. The objective is to efficiently pack items into containers (bins) while minimizing waste and meeting physical constraints. This implementation leverages advanced **metaheuristics** to achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions in a computationally feasible manner.

## **Metaheuristics Used**

### **1. Genetic Algorithm (GA):**
- Simulates natural selection through encoding, crossover, and mutation.
- **Enhancements:**
  - **Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA):** Introduces directed randomness to improve convergence rates.
  - **Elite Population Handling:** Retains a fraction of the fittest solutions to preserve high-quality candidates across generations.

### **2. OctaBranching Strategy:**
- Divides the 3D space into octants for intelligent item placement.
- Dynamically uses reference points to reduce search space complexity while maintaining solution feasibility.

### **3. Tie-Breaking Heuristics:**
- Selects optimal placements based on:
  - Height minimization.
  - Overlap maximization.
  - Distance from container edges.

## **Key Features**

- **Support for Physical Constraints:**
  - Placement rules for fragile, heavy, and incompatible items.
  - Stability metrics to minimize risks like toppling or shifting.

- **Stability Optimization:**
  - Balances weight distribution using metrics like:
    - Center of gravity.
    - Base support.
    - Stacking factor.

- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Reduces container usage and penalizes the spread of high-priority items across multiple containers.

- **Rotational and Geometric Adaptability:**
  - Items can be rotated and placed in various orientations to maximize space utilization.

## **How It Works**

1. **Problem Encoding:**
   - Items are encoded as chromosomes using random keys.
   - Separate sequences for priority and non-priority items to respect specific constraints.

2. **Solution Generation:**
   - Iterative evaluation and improvement of solutions based on fitness scores.
   - Fitness includes penalties for constraint violations and rewards for efficient packing.

3. **Stability Metrics:**
   - Ensures rotational and translational stability.
   - Adds cushioning material where necessary for safety.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Generates a loading plan with detailed placement coordinates.
   - Visualizes the solution using a 3D interface for better understanding.

## **Applications**

- **Logistics and Warehousing:** Automating packing processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
- **E-commerce and Retail:** Optimizing shipment packing to maximize transportation capacity.
- **Aerospace and Shipping:** Ensuring safe and stable load distribution for cargo.

## **Why Metaheuristics?**

Metaheuristics are essential for problems like 3D-BPP due to the exponential growth of the solution space with problem size. Traditional exact methods (e.g., linear programming) are computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems. Metaheuristics strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, providing high-quality solutions in reasonable time.
